# Project Title

Alarms we use in our daily routine are generally time based. Many
situations may need us to have an alarm/reminder based on "location"
and not time.Hence we have proposed a
system where user can sit back and relax while our app continuously
tracks the location and notifies upon arrival. This system tracks the
user location with the help of GPS. On arrival, alarm shall be rung
along with the task description. The above features
are implemented by using JavaScript, HTML, SASS framework,
bootstrap as front end tools. The PWA will make use of Google maps API to track
locations. The back end will be supported by Python with Django
framework and MongoDb respectively.
